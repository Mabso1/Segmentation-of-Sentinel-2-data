# Segmentation-of-Sentinel-2-data

This repository provides a tutorial for working with Sentinel-2 hyperspectral data in remote sensing for semantic segmentation of crop types in Pytorch. 

The data utalized in repository is provided by the DENETHOR dataset found at the following repo: [DENETHOR](https://github.com/lukaskondmann/DENETHOR).

# Requriements

To susccesfully run this tutorial the following must be downloaded (using pip is probably the easiest)

```
pip install 
pip install
pip install
```
# Running the Code

To run the code there are two option, either download the python scripts directly from the folders "Pytorch code" and "Data Preprocessing" and run this in your favourite IDE. The second option is to download the juptyer notebook format directly and run the code from there as an alternative. As an alternative to training the model from strach, it is possible to download a tranined model from the bst_model file located in the "Pretrained" folder.
